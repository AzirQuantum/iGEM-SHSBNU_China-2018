With a boarding campus, the international division is independent from the main campus of SHSBNU. It serves about eight-hundred students, including students from Project Global Access (PGA) and the Nacel International Exchange Program. PGA is a Sino-US Joint Program, introduced to the International Division in 2008, approved by the Beijing Municipal Education Commission and registered with the Ministry of Education. There are about 360 Chinese students enrolled in the PGA program, from grade 10 to grade 12. Teachers in PGA are also well-qualified, with a total of 53 Chinese and foreign teachers. The faculty includes experienced educators from China, US, Britain, The Philippines, and South Africa, some of which are alumni of international institutions such as Northwestern University, University of Michigan, Messey University, etc.
